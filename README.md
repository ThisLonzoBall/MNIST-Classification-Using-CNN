## 🧠 MNIST Digit Classification with PyTorch

This project trains and evaluates neural networks to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using PyTorch. It includes:

- 📦 **Loading and visualizing MNIST data**
- 🏗️ **Building three different models:**
  - **Model 0**: Baseline fully connected neural network  
  - **Model 1**: Fully connected network with non-linear activations  
  - **Model 2**: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with two Conv blocks
- 🧪 **Custom training and evaluation loops with timing**
- 📚 **Model performance comparison with accuracy and training time**
- 🔍 **Visualizing predictions and plotting a confusion matrix**
