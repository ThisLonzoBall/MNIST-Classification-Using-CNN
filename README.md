# MNIST-Classification-Using-CNN
This project builds and compares three neural network models (a baseline feedforward network, a non-linear model, and a CNN) to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using PyTorch. It includes data loading, training and evaluation loops, model timing, prediction visualization, and confusion matrix analysis.
